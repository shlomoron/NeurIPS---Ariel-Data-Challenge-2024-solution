# NeurIPS---Ariel-Data-Challenge-2024  
This repository contains my solution (4th place, solo gold medal) for the Kaggle competition of [NeurIPS - Ariel Data Challenge 2024]([https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/leap-atmospheric-physics-ai-climsim](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ariel-data-challenge-2024/discussion/543776)). See also my summary [on Kaggle]().  

# The steps to reproduce my solution
## 1. Preprocessing
[Here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shlomoron/adc24-preprocessing).
## 2. Tensorflow regression models  
[First TF model](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shlomoron/adc24-model-2) and [second TF model](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shlomoron/adc24-model-3).  
## 3. Postprocessing
[First model (classical polyfit) postprocessing](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shlomoron/adc24-model-1-postprocessing), [First TF mpdel postprocessing](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shlomoron/adc24-model-2-postprocessing) and [second TF model postprocessing](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shlomoron/adc24-model-3-postprocessing).
